# pact-java
A consumer-driven contract testing example using pact-jvm, spring boot, and maven 

## Running the consumer
    mvn test

This will create a pact file in target/pacts. If the tests pass, we know that the consumer interacts correctly with the contract.

## Running the provider
Start the provider application

    mvn spring-boot:run

In a separate window/process

    mvn pact:verify

If the tests pass, we know that the provider adheres to the contract that was generated by the consumer. The pact which the provider is validating against resides in src/main/resources/pact-from-consumer, but can be configured to come from VCS or the Pact broker
